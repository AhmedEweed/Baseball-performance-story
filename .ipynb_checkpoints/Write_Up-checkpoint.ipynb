    "Baseball performance depends on many variables.  \n",

    "Weight and height seem to have no significant effect on home runs or batting average from player to another."

    "# Design\n",
    "\n",
    "I prefered a simple design with all of the charts as bar charts  \n",
    "as the dataset has four numeric variables (Weight, height, HR and batting average)  \n",
    "and only two categorical variables (Name and handedness).  \n",
    "Therefore a bar chart is most suitble for numeric data\n",
    "\n",
    "also I used size as an encoding for batting average from small to large.  \n",
    "I found that most of my friends have little knowledge about baseball itself!  \n",
    "but with good design practices I succeded in conveying my message.\n",
